Digital Carb Sync Shield
========================

Motorcycle carburetor synchronization. Analog sensors. LCD display.

This repository is for the Digital Carb Sync Shield project. The shield is designed for the Arduino UNO R3
and other compatible boards.

The software is licensed under the MIT model.
The hardware is licensed using Open Hardware License.

The shield reads up to 6 vacuum pressure sensors on A0-5 and displays running peaks.

There is a calibration step to average the analog inputs. This is to compensate for build quality issues.

###Bill of Materials#

Partial BOM sourced at Digi-Key. Shop around.

Also requires 16x2 LCD such as this standard LCD from Adafruit. NOTE:
This LCD comes with a header strip which reduces the need for headers on
the BOM. It also comes with a trimmer pot the board is NOT designed for. https://www.adafruit.com/products/181
